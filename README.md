Strat Roulette+ is written in Pure HTML, CSS and JS
It depends on Bootstrap, Popper.js and JQuery, but they are built in, so you should be able to just glue it in `/var/www/` without any node or yarn or anything

DB is literally just static JSON in `./js/strats.js`, so if you fork the project, it shouldnt be hard to port to another game.
I apologize for my spaghetti JS code, I hate not having my strict types.
